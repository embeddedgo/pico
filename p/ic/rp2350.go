//
// Registers:
//
//	0x000 32  IC_CON                 I2C Control Register. This register can be written only when the DW_apb_i2c is disabled, which corresponds to the IC_ENABLE[0] register being set to 0. Writes at other times have no effect. Read/Write Access: - bit 10 is read only. - bit 11 is read only - bit 16 is read only - bit 17 is read only - bits 18 and 19 are read only.
//	0x004 32  IC_TAR                 I2C Target Address Register This register is 12 bits wide, and bits 31:12 are reserved. This register can be written to only when IC_ENABLE[0] is set to 0. Note: If the software or application is aware that the DW_apb_i2c is not using the TAR address for the pending commands in the Tx FIFO, then it is possible to update the TAR address even while the Tx FIFO has entries (IC_STATUS[2]= 0). - It is not necessary to perform any write to this register if DW_apb_i2c is enabled as an I2C slave only.
//	0x008 32  IC_SAR                 I2C Slave Address Register
//	0x010 32  IC_DATA_CMD            I2C Rx/Tx Data Buffer and Command Register; this is the register the CPU writes to when filling the TX FIFO and the CPU reads from when retrieving bytes from RX FIFO. The size of the register changes as follows: Write: - 11 bits when IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN=1 - 9 bits when IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN=0 Read: - 12 bits when IC_FIRST_DATA_BYTE_STATUS = 1 - 8 bits when IC_FIRST_DATA_BYTE_STATUS = 0 Note: In order for the DW_apb_i2c to continue acknowledging reads, a read command should be written for every byte that is to be received; otherwise the DW_apb_i2c will stop acknowledging.
//	0x014 32  IC_SS_SCL_HCNT         Standard Speed I2C Clock SCL High Count Register
//	0x018 32  IC_SS_SCL_LCNT         Standard Speed I2C Clock SCL Low Count Register
//	0x01C 32  IC_FS_SCL_HCNT         Fast Mode or Fast Mode Plus I2C Clock SCL High Count Register
//	0x020 32  IC_FS_SCL_LCNT         Fast Mode or Fast Mode Plus I2C Clock SCL Low Count Register
//	0x02C 32  IC_INTR_STAT           I2C Interrupt Status Register Each bit in this register has a corresponding mask bit in the IC_INTR_MASK register. These bits are cleared by reading the matching interrupt clear register. The unmasked raw versions of these bits are available in the IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register.
//	0x030 32  IC_INTR_MASK           I2C Interrupt Mask Register. These bits mask their corresponding interrupt status bits. This register is active low; a value of 0 masks the interrupt, whereas a value of 1 unmasks the interrupt.
//	0x034 32  IC_RAW_INTR_STAT       I2C Raw Interrupt Status Register Unlike the IC_INTR_STAT register, these bits are not masked so they always show the true status of the DW_apb_i2c.
//	0x038 32  IC_RX_TL               I2C Receive FIFO Threshold Register
//	0x03C 32  IC_TX_TL               I2C Transmit FIFO Threshold Register
//	0x040 32  IC_CLR_INTR            Clear Combined and Individual Interrupt Register
//	0x044 32  IC_CLR_RX_UNDER        Clear RX_UNDER Interrupt Register
//	0x048 32  IC_CLR_RX_OVER         Clear RX_OVER Interrupt Register
//	0x04C 32  IC_CLR_TX_OVER         Clear TX_OVER Interrupt Register
//	0x050 32  IC_CLR_RD_REQ          Clear RD_REQ Interrupt Register
//	0x054 32  IC_CLR_TX_ABRT         Clear TX_ABRT Interrupt Register
//	0x058 32  IC_CLR_RX_DONE         Clear RX_DONE Interrupt Register
//	0x05C 32  IC_CLR_ACTIVITY        Clear ACTIVITY Interrupt Register
//	0x060 32  IC_CLR_STOP_DET        Clear STOP_DET Interrupt Register
//	0x064 32  IC_CLR_START_DET       Clear START_DET Interrupt Register
//	0x068 32  IC_CLR_GEN_CALL        Clear GEN_CALL Interrupt Register
//	0x06C 32  IC_ENABLE              I2C Enable Register
//	0x070 32  IC_STATUS              I2C Status Register This is a read-only register used to indicate the current transfer status and FIFO status. The status register may be read at any time. None of the bits in this register request an interrupt. When the I2C is disabled by writing 0 in bit 0 of the IC_ENABLE register: - Bits 1 and 2 are set to 1 - Bits 3 and 10 are set to 0 When the master or slave state machines goes to idle and ic_en=0: - Bits 5 and 6 are set to 0
//	0x074 32  IC_TXFLR               I2C Transmit FIFO Level Register This register contains the number of valid data entries in the transmit FIFO buffer. It is cleared whenever: - The I2C is disabled - There is a transmit abort - that is, TX_ABRT bit is set in the IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register - The slave bulk transmit mode is aborted The register increments whenever data is placed into the transmit FIFO and decrements when data is taken from the transmit FIFO.
//	0x078 32  IC_RXFLR               I2C Receive FIFO Level Register This register contains the number of valid data entries in the receive FIFO buffer. It is cleared whenever: - The I2C is disabled - Whenever there is a transmit abort caused by any of the events tracked in IC_TX_ABRT_SOURCE The register increments whenever data is placed into the receive FIFO and decrements when data is taken from the receive FIFO.
//	0x07C 32  IC_SDA_HOLD            I2C SDA Hold Time Length Register The bits [15:0] of this register are used to control the hold time of SDA during transmit in both slave and master mode (after SCL goes from HIGH to LOW). The bits [23:16] of this register are used to extend the SDA transition (if any) whenever SCL is HIGH in the receiver in either master or slave mode. Writes to this register succeed only when IC_ENABLE[0]=0. The values in this register are in units of ic_clk period. The value programmed in IC_SDA_TX_HOLD must be greater than the minimum hold time in each mode (one cycle in master mode, seven cycles in slave mode) for the value to be implemented. The programmed SDA hold time during transmit (IC_SDA_TX_HOLD) cannot exceed at any time the duration of the low part of scl. Therefore the programmed value cannot be larger than N_SCL_LOW-2, where N_SCL_LOW is the duration of the low part of the scl period measured in ic_clk cycles.
//	0x080 32  IC_TX_ABRT_SOURCE      I2C Transmit Abort Source Register This register has 32 bits that indicate the source of the TX_ABRT bit. Except for Bit 9, this register is cleared whenever the IC_CLR_TX_ABRT register or the IC_CLR_INTR register is read. To clear Bit 9, the source of the ABRT_SBYTE_NORSTRT must be fixed first; RESTART must be enabled (IC_CON[5]=1), the SPECIAL bit must be cleared (IC_TAR[11]), or the GC_OR_START bit must be cleared (IC_TAR[10]). Once the source of the ABRT_SBYTE_NORSTRT is fixed, then this bit can be cleared in the same manner as other bits in this register. If the source of the ABRT_SBYTE_NORSTRT is not fixed before attempting to clear this bit, Bit 9 clears for one cycle and is then re-asserted.
//	0x084 32  IC_SLV_DATA_NACK_ONLY  Generate Slave Data NACK Register The register is used to generate a NACK for the data part of a transfer when DW_apb_i2c is acting as a slave-receiver. This register only exists when the IC_SLV_DATA_NACK_ONLY parameter is set to 1. When this parameter disabled, this register does not exist and writing to the register's address has no effect. A write can occur on this register if both of the following conditions are met: - DW_apb_i2c is disabled (IC_ENABLE[0] = 0) - Slave part is inactive (IC_STATUS[6] = 0) Note: The IC_STATUS[6] is a register read-back location for the internal slv_activity signal; the user should poll this before writing the ic_slv_data_nack_only bit.
//	0x088 32  IC_DMA_CR              DMA Control Register The register is used to enable the DMA Controller interface operation. There is a separate bit for transmit and receive. This can be programmed regardless of the state of IC_ENABLE.
//	0x08C 32  IC_DMA_TDLR            DMA Transmit Data Level Register
//	0x090 32  IC_DMA_RDLR            I2C Receive Data Level Register
//	0x094 32  IC_SDA_SETUP           I2C SDA Setup Register This register controls the amount of time delay (in terms of number of ic_clk clock periods) introduced in the rising edge of SCL - relative to SDA changing - when DW_apb_i2c services a read request in a slave-transmitter operation. The relevant I2C requirement is tSU:DAT (note 4) as detailed in the I2C Bus Specification. This register must be programmed with a value equal to or greater than 2. Writes to this register succeed only when IC_ENABLE[0] = 0. Note: The length of setup time is calculated using [(IC_SDA_SETUP - 1) * (ic_clk_period)], so if the user requires 10 ic_clk periods of setup time, they should program a value of 11. The IC_SDA_SETUP register is only used by the DW_apb_i2c when operating as a slave transmitter.
//	0x098 32  IC_ACK_GENERAL_CALL    I2C ACK General Call Register The register controls whether DW_apb_i2c responds with a ACK or NACK when it receives an I2C General Call address. This register is applicable only when the DW_apb_i2c is in slave mode.
//	0x09C 32  IC_ENABLE_STATUS       I2C Enable Status Register The register is used to report the DW_apb_i2c hardware status when the IC_ENABLE[0] register is set from 1 to 0; that is, when DW_apb_i2c is disabled. If IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 1, bits 2:1 are forced to 0, and bit 0 is forced to 1. If IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 0, bits 2:1 is only be valid as soon as bit 0 is read as '0'. Note: When IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 0, a delay occurs for bit 0 to be read as 0 because disabling the DW_apb_i2c depends on I2C bus activities.
//	0x0A0 32  IC_FS_SPKLEN           I2C SS, FS or FM+ spike suppression limit This register is used to store the duration, measured in ic_clk cycles, of the longest spike that is filtered out by the spike suppression logic when the component is operating in SS, FS or FM+ modes. The relevant I2C requirement is tSP (table 4) as detailed in the I2C Bus Specification. This register must be programmed with a minimum value of 1.
//	0x0A8 32  IC_CLR_RESTART_DET     Clear RESTART_DET Interrupt Register
//	0x0F4 32  IC_COMP_PARAM_1        Component Parameter Register 1 Note This register is not implemented and therefore reads as 0. If it was implemented it would be a constant read-only register that contains encoded information about the component's parameter settings. Fields shown below are the settings for those parameters
//	0x0F8 32  IC_COMP_VERSION        I2C Component Version Register
//	0x0FC 32  IC_COMP_TYPE           I2C Component Type Register

However, it is important that care be taken to ensure that DW_apb_i2c is disabled properly. A recommended procedure is described in 'Disabling DW_apb_i2c'. When DW_apb_i2c is disabled, the following occurs: - The TX FIFO and RX FIFO get flushed. - Status bits in the IC_INTR_STAT register are still active until DW_apb_i2c goes into IDLE state. If the module is transmitting, it stops as well as deletes the contents of the transmit buffer after the current transfer is complete. If the module is receiving, the DW_apb_i2c stops the current transfer at the end of the current byte and does not acknowledge the transfer. In systems with asynchronous pclk and ic_clk when IC_CLK_TYPE parameter set to asynchronous (1), there is a two ic_clk delay when enabling or disabling the DW_apb_i2c.

In response to an ABORT, the controller issues a STOP and flushes the Tx FIFO after completing the current transfer, then sets the TX_ABORT interrupt after the abort operation.

This bit always reflects the value driven on the output port ic_en. - When read as 1, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to be in an enabled state. - When read as 0, DW_apb_i2c is deemed completely inactive. Note: The CPU can safely read this bit anytime. When this bit is read as 0, the CPU can safely read SLV_RX_DATA_LOST (bit 2) and SLV_DISABLED_WHILE_BUSY (bit 1). Reset value: 0x0
	DISABLED                IC_ENABLE_STATUS = 0x00 << 0 //  I2C disabled

	SLV_DISABLED_WHILE_BUSY IC_ENABLE_STATUS = 0x01 << 1 //+ Slave Disabled While Busy (Transmit, Receive). This bit indicates if a potential or active Slave operation has been aborted due to the setting bit 0 of the IC_ENABLE register from 1 to 0. This bit is set when the CPU writes a 0 to the IC_ENABLE register while: (a) DW_apb_i2c is receiving the address byte of the Slave-Transmitter operation from a remote master; OR, (b) address and data bytes of the Slave-Receiver operation from a remote master. When read as 1, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to have forced a NACK during any part of an I2C transfer, irrespective of whether the I2C address matches the slave address set in DW_apb_i2c (IC_SAR register) OR if the transfer is completed before IC_ENABLE is set to 0 but has not taken effect. Note: If the remote I2C master terminates the transfer with a STOP condition before the DW_apb_i2c has a chance to NACK a transfer, and IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 0, then this bit will also be set to 1. When read as 0, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to have been disabled when there is master activity, or when the I2C bus is idle. Note: The CPU can safely read this bit when IC_EN (bit 0) is read as 0. Reset value: 0x0

	SLV_RX_DATA_LOST        IC_ENABLE_STATUS = 0x01 << 2 //+ Slave Received Data Lost. This bit indicates if a Slave-Receiver operation has been aborted with at least one data byte received from an I2C transfer due to the setting bit 0 of IC_ENABLE from 1 to 0. When read as 1, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to have been actively engaged in an aborted I2C transfer (with matching address) and the data phase of the I2C transfer has been entered, even though a data byte has been responded with a NACK. Note: If the remote I2C master terminates the transfer with a STOP condition before the DW_apb_i2c has a chance to NACK a transfer, and IC_ENABLE[0] has been set to 0, then this bit is also set to 1. When read as 0, DW_apb_i2c is deemed to have been disabled without being actively involved in the data phase of a Slave-Receiver transfer. Note: The CPU can safely read this bit when IC_EN (bit 0) is read as 0. Reset value: 0x0
